# Overview

My software I made was using Blender and Python lines of code to literally script shapes.
What I learned about this is that you can literally use lines of code to define shapes and their
Dimensions and this in turn can be used for 3D modeling. An example of this would be making a model 
of a product as a visual reference or guide.
